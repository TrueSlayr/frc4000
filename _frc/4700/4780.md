The Tenacious Drones is an organization made up of students and staff of Parma Community High School. We have competed in a variety of different competitions, but our main focus is FRC. We are Team 4780, The Tenacious Drones.  We got our start in December of 2012, when a parent suggested that our Science Club get involved in FRC. Our teachers looked into it and thought it was a cool idea, so they registered us for the Buckeye Regional. Our 2 science teachers at the time went to Tri-C on kickoff day to get our kit of parts. Soon afterward, we had our first official meeting. We jumped into FRC head-first, learning as we went along. Our team was about 9 kids, with 2 parents involved. Our rookie year was rough, but somehow, we managed to get a robot put together and working by bag and tag night. I don't think that anyone knew what we were in for when we decided to sign up, but we made it work, and it paid off. Since then, our team has evolved a lot. We've found several sponsors, and several mentors who have continued to support us these past 6 years.
